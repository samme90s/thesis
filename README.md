# Thesis

## Study plan

1. Schedule a meeting with the supervisor (once a week)
   - Describe what I have done.
   - Compile at least three questions.
   - Ask what is expected to be done until the next meeting and outline this!

### Argumentation structure

1. Summary
   (Explain the area of focus)
2. Positioning  
   (How do I position ourselves in relation to what is described in the summary?
   Highlight where there is a knowledge gap.)
3. Justification  
   (Why do I position ourselves this way, and is there any follow-up to consider?)

## Method

### Tools

- Evaluation of LLMs

### Alternatives

Work on the method to make it engaging.

Test different prompts to see if the results change.
For example, should we use a series of prompts or one?

Emphasize that these are specific work orders and leverage the fact that there is a
particular type of structure, as opposed to classic text.

Parts of the method that could be relevant:

Example 1:

1. Select five individuals who receive 20 different work orders and categorize them.
2. Have an LLM categorize the same work orders.
3. Compare the results.

Example 2:

1. Provide predefined categories to the LLM.
2. Let the LLM categorize work orders.
3. Assess whether these categories seem reasonable.
