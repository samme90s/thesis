# Thesis

## Ballpark

Test different prompts to see if the results change.
For example, should we use a series of prompts or one?

Emphasize that these are specific work orders and leverage the fact that there is a
particular type of structure, as opposed to classic text.

Parts of the method that could be relevant:

Example 1:

1. Select five individuals who receive 20 different work orders and categorize them.
2. Have an LLM categorize the same work orders.
3. Compare the results.

Example 2:

1. Provide predefined categories to the LLM.
2. Let the LLM categorize work orders.
3. Assess whether these categories seem reasonable.
