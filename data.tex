\section{Data}

The experiment is conducted using anonymized work orders, but may still contain
sensitive information.
Therefore, when presenting potentially sensitive information it will be replaced
as dummy data.
This will be clarified beforehand.

The data contains \colorbox{yellow}{UNKNOWN} work orders, without relations
to each other.
It is unstructured, meaning that the data does not have predefined categories.
The data comes in the form of text (English) and numerical values.
We have opted to only use the titles and descriptions of the work orders,
as these are the most relevant for the classification task, and will be used to
verify the correctness of the LLMs.

When working with the ML model, we will use a manually structured subset of the
data.
Using a subset allows us to put the primary focus on the LLMs, as manually
labeling the entire dataset would not be feasible within the time frame of this
thesis.

    dataset.}
