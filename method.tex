% It should include:
%
% The type of research you conducted
% How you collected and analyzed your data
% Any tools or materials you used in the research
% How you mitigated or avoided research biases
% Why you chose these methods
%
% Your methodology section should generally be written in the PAST TENSE!

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Experiment design}
% Step 1:
% Methodological approach
%
% Research problem:
% Gain more understanding
%
% Type of data?
%
% How data was collected?
% Primary (collect by myself) or Secondary (collected by someone else) data:
We conducted a quantitative experimental study to evaluate the performance of two
models, Deepseek and Deepseek (reasoning), on the UPTILT dataset. Metrics such
as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and execution time were collected
using primary data obtained through controlled experiments. This approach was chosen
to ensure measurable and reproducible results.

\subsubsection{Independent variables}
% Not sure if this is correct outlining the variables like this but may be useful
% to get the general idea of what we are working with:
%
% A variable is anything that can change or be changed => any factor that can be
% manipulated, controlled for, or measured in an experiment.
%
% Independent variables:
% These are factors that you can manipulate in an experiment.
% Our hypothesis is that respective independent variable causes a direct effect on
% the dependent variable(s).
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
        Dataset & The UPTILT dataset used for training and evaluation.     \\
        Models  & The different models used (both LLMs and ML algorithms). \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Dependent variables}
% Dependent variables:
% These are factors that you can observe or measure. As we change the independent variable(s),
% we observe what happens to the dependent variable(s).
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
        Accuracy            & The overall correctness of the model.           \\
        Precision           & The correctness of positive predictions.        \\
        Recall              & The ability to identify all relevant instances. \\
        F1 score            & A combined metric of precision and recall.      \\
        Execution time (ms) & The computational efficiency of each model.     \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Hypotheses}
% (hypotheis: singular | hypotheses: plural)
% What are we trying to prove?
% Should be a statement that can be proven or disproven. Thus, it must be testable...
\textcolor{blue}{See RQ1 and RQ2 here and build the hypotheses based on these.}

\subsubsection{Predictions}
% Based on the hypotheses, what do we expect to see?

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Data Collection}
% Step 2:
% Methods of data collection
%
% The sampling method or critera
% The tools, procedures, and materials
% How variables were measured
%
% Explain the table structure here as well!
% See Oxana's model/image in Slack.
\textcolor{blue}{Explain the tools and methods used to collect the data for our
result. Furthermore, explain the variables that were measured. See comments...}

\subsubsection{Models}
% Specify the LLMs and ML models/algorithms used (e.g., GPT-4o, Deepseek, Naive Bayes).
%
% Explain why these models were chosen and how they are relevant to the research question.

\subsubsection{Configurations}
% Describe whether the models are pre-trained, fine-tuned, or used with prompt engineering.
% Explain any hyperparameter tuning performed (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
% Discuss the computational resources required (e.g., GPUs, cloud services).
%
% Use references to support our choices here!

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Data Analysis}
% Step 3:
% Describe the methods of analysis
% (i.e. how you processed and analyzed the data).
%
% Quantitative data:
% - Data preparation
% - Software
% - Statistical methods
%
% Analysis based of:
% - Language
% - Images
% - Interpretations
% - Themes and Patterns
\textcolor{blue}{Explain the methods used to analyze the collected data. See comments...}

% --------------------------------------------
\subsection{Research Biases}
% Step 4:
% Evaluate and justify methodological choices:
%
% Why you chose these particular methods?
% Why other methods were not suitable for your objectives?
% How this approach contributes new knowledge or understanding?
