%
% It should include:
%
% The type of research you conducted
% How you collected and analyzed your data
% Any tools or materials you used in the research
% How you mitigated or avoided research biases
% Why you chose these methods
%
% Your methodology section should generally be written in the PAST TENSE!

\subsection{Introduction}
% Step 1:
% Methodological approach
%
% Research problem:
% Gain more understanding
%
% Type of data?
%
% How data was collected?
% Primary (collect by myself) or Secondary (collected by someone else) data:
We have conducted a quantitative (numerical) research study to evaluate the performance
of Deepseek and Deepseek (reasoning) on the dataset provided by UPTILT. We have
collected the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and execution time of the
two models. We used the primary method of collecting data with the tools and procedures
described in the following sections.

\subsection{Independent variables}
% Not sure if this is correct outlining the variables like this but may be useful
% to get the general idea of what we are working with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset

    \item Deepseek

    \item Deepseek (reasoning)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependent variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy % Measures overall correctness

    \item Precision % Measures the correctness of positive predictions; not the same as accuracy

    \item Recall

    \item F1 score

    \item Execution time (ms)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Collection}
% Step 2:
% Methods of data collection
%
% The sampling method or critera
% The tools, procedures, and materials
% How variables were measured
\textcolor{blue}{Explain the tools and methods used to collect the data for our
result. Furthermore, explain the variables that were measured. See comments...}

\subsection{Data Analysis}
% Step 3:
% Describe the methods of analysis
% (i.e. how you processed and analyzed the data).
%
% Quantitative data:
% Data preparation
% Software
% Statistical methods
%
% Analysis based of:
% Language
% Images
% Interpretations
% Themes and Patterns
\textcolor{blue}{Explain the methods used to analyze the collected data. See comments...}

\subsection{Research Biases}
% Step 4:
% Evaluate and justify methodological choices
%
% Why you chose these particular methods
% Why other methods were not suitable for your objectives
% How this approach contributes new knowledge or understanding
