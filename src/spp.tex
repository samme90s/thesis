\subsection{Cooperative Partners}

We will cooperate with UPTILT, who are currently working on delivering a program
to customers within the service business.
They aim to deliver a product meant to keep track of materials and hourly work
to automate the delivery of invoices and offers to the customer.

We have continous discussions and meetings with the company.

\subsection{Preliminary Title}

Automated Text Categorization for work orders using LLM

\subsection{Elevator Pitch}

Automatic text categorization is an important step when analyzing textual data,
and the approach of Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative
to the traditional Machine Learning (ML).
ML often requires balanced, labeled datasets for effective training
and demands significant manual effort, in contrast to LLMs that
leverages pre-trained contextual knowledge.
We aim to use LLMs to categorize work order (WO) titles and descriptions
through a rigorous method,
and evaluate the impact of different prompts and strategies to find
an effective solution to the subject at hand.

\subsection{Steps/Milestones/Actions}

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Find related work.
      \item Create two questions related to our different strategies used
            when using the LLM (this is for each of us to have an area of
            greater responsibility).
      \item Define method (be creative here to find interresting approaches
            to our problem).
      \item Conduct experiment.
      \item Analyze results.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Risks}

\begin{itemize}
      \item No previous experience in creating a method, so we will have to rely on our
            supervisor here.
      \item Finding creative and concrete ways to test the effectiveness and accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

In many industries today, working with and handling large quantities of structured and unstructured data is extremely
important. One example is categorization of WOs in fields such as manufacturing, logistics and maintenance.

Traditionally, ML methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and Naïve Bayes classifiers
have been used for text classification task. These ML methods have also been applied to the topic of
this paper, i.e., text classification. These approaches require manual testing and overlooking. This can result in
problems when it comes to scalability and handling different text formats.

To address the question if we can't find a more effective solution to this current workflow
when dealing with text classification, this paper explores the usage of LLMs for automated
text categorization for WOs.

\colorbox{green}{startade på en kort introduktion bara varför vi gör detta}

\subsubsection{WOs}

WOs is a document that outlines the details of a maintenance task or the material and more required
to complete such task \cite{ibm2023}.

WOs is a key component in maintenance management in complex facilities. However, many existing companies
still rely on manual processing, which can lead to mistakes caused by human error. WOs contain valuable
data in the form of text, which, if properly utilized, can improve task such as maintenance planing and worker assignments.
However, the challenge is when the data is unstructured, it complicates their usages in automated systems \cite{li2023}.

\subsubsection{Automated Text Categorization}

LLMs or often described as AI nowadays and allows the user to prompt it with instructions or questions.
LLMs leverage pre-trained knowledge, unlike traditional ML models, which require
manual testing and human intervention. They can analyze data and recognize patterns with minimal
human intervention. This makes LLMs highly effective in applications like WO categorization.

\colorbox{yellow}{continue with a short description of LLM and add source/reference}

Assigning text to pre-defined categories is the key of text categorization
(sometimes named classification, but we will stick to the former).
These may include areas such as topic labeling or news categorization \cite{zhang2024}.
It has further proved that the latest LLMs currently posses great generative capabilities,
understanding and reasoning within language(s).
They therefore have become more efficient than humans when it comes to NLP (Natural Language Processing)
tasks.

Automated Text classification is a ML process that involves categorizing documents
into predefined groups by analyzing the content of the text and identifying features that are
relevant \cite{dalal2011}. By utulizing automated text classification, computer systems
can use this technique for solving tasks such as spam filtering and document organization.

\subsubsection{Related Work}

\colorbox{yellow}{Reveal other studies and their conclusions, position ourselves and motivate...}

Huang and He \cite{huang2024} explain the cost of manual labor when it comes to tagging and categorizing text.
Furthermore, the fine-tuning and choice of parameters can influence the final behaviour of the trained
ML model.
They explain how the latest LLMs have showcased "remarkable reasoning performance across a wide range of
NLP tasks".
We aim to follow this trail and further analyze the effeciency and performance of categoring text or as in our
case WOs.

Advances have been made recently in LLMs when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks, such as text classification.
GPT-4, LLaMA 2, and ChatGLM 2 have shown remarkable performance in various NLP-tasks, including text classification.
\cite{zhang2024}.
Our research in this paper will be to discuss and evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of using LLMs
to text classify structured WOs. Unlike previous studies, which focus more on general NLP tasks,
our paper give an insight into whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to effectively classify structured WOs and
compare their performance to traditional text classification methods.

Recent research has demonstrated that transformer-based models,
such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and other domain-specific variants,
significantly improve text classification processes trough transfer learning and fine-tuning \cite{Nazyrova2024}.
While this study focus on medical text classification, its findings in on LLM fine-tuning is releveant for our
paper and its research.
