# Review

## Instructions

Read the introductions and glance through the Method chapter
For your study try finding the answers to the following questions, but note that these may lack to some extent on some of these. (in groups of 2-3 students)

1. What are their research and application areas? Make a funnelâ€¦

   <!-- - Research Area: Computer Science
     Application Area: Computer Science -->

   - Research Area: Computer Science
   - Application Area: Economics

2. How is the research gap described? For each of the related works, how are they related to the thesis? make a mindmap with the thesis in the middle and named relations.

   <!-- - The research gap is to find out how GCC (Github Copilot Chat) can be used seperate and in conjunction with
     manual labor to create new tests.  -->

   - Show the potential challenges and solutions for automated categorisation of public transactions (CPV).

3. What is the knowledge contribution of this? ( What was not known before that is provided in this thesis? ) Is this computer science?

   - Provide insights to LLM using word embeddings of categorisation of public transactions
     and analyze how well it works even on unbalanced datasets.

4. What are the motivations behind the research? Of what kind of use can this research be used? ( Scientific, Societal, Economic, Ethical )

   - It will benefit finding products and sales related to the company's interest using categories named CPV
     (which provides a way to find products no matter what language) and also reduce the manual labor to categories
     products being listed by each respective company.

5. Action: What did the student do to find new knowledge?

    - 

6. Target Group Who should be interested in reading this thesis?
    
    - Both CS/Economics...

7. What did you lack in the introduction? What could have been done better?

    - Explaining the concept of CPV a little better as it wasn't all clear for me to begin with.

Prepare a quick presentation for a slightly larger group. Presentations in larger groups 6-9 students.

Group presentation
Each group presents (5-10 min per group) the answers to some of the questions
Discuss

Overview and time plan
Theory Research gap 45 minutes
Work in pairs 60 min - Reading examples -> checking the important references
Presentations in larger groups 30 min
Work in pairs formulating Elevator pitches for your work.
